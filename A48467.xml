            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>'Tis a very great unhappine≈ø≈øe we well know, to be alwayes ≈øtrugling and ≈øtriving in the world, and does wholly keep us from the enjoyment of tho≈øe contentments our ≈øeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Conditions reach unto: So that if we ≈øhould con≈øult only with our ≈øelves, and regard only our own ea≈øe, Wee ≈øhould never enterpo≈øe as we have done, in behalfe of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth: But when ≈øo much has been done for recovery of our Liberties, and ≈øeeing God hath ≈øo ble≈øt that which has been done, as thereby to cleer the way, and to afford an opportunity which the≈øe 600 years has been de≈øired, but could never be attained; of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king this a <hi>truly happy</hi> and <hi>wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>lly Free</hi> Nation; We think our ≈øelves bound by the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øt obligations that may be, to prevent the neglect of this opportunity, and to hinder as much as lyes in us, that the bloud which has been ≈øhed be not ≈øpilt like water upon the ground, nor that after the abundant Calamities, which have over≈øpread all quarters of the Land, the change be onely Notionall, Nominall, Circum≈øtantiall, whil≈øt the reall Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, Grievances, and Bondages, be continued, even when the Monarchy is changed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Republike.</p>
            <p>We are no more concern'd indeed then other men, and could bear the Yoke we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve as ea≈øily as others; but ≈øince a Common Duty lyes upon every man to be cautious and circum≈øpect in behalfe of his Country, e≈øpecially while the Government thereof is ≈øetling, other mens neglect is ≈øo far we thinke from being a ju≈øt motive to us of the like ≈øloath an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inanimiadvertency,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61868:3"/>as that it rather requires of us an increa≈øe of care and circum≈øpection which if it produces not ≈øo good a ≈øettlement as ought to be, yet certainly it will prevent its being ≈øo bad as otherwi≈øe it would be, if we ≈øhould all only mind our particular cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and imployments.</p>
            <p>So that although per≈øonally we may ≈øuffer, yet our ≈øolace is that the Common-wealth is therby ≈øome gainer, and we doubt not but that God in his due time wil ≈øo cleerly di≈øpel the Clouds of Ignominy and Obloquy which now ≈øurround us by keeping our hearts upright and our ≈øpirits ≈øincerely publike, that every good man will give us the right hand of fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhip, and be even ≈øorry that they have been e≈øtranged, and ≈øo hardly opinionated again≈øt us: We que≈øtion not but that in time the rea≈øon of ≈øuch mi≈øpri≈øions will appeare to be in their eyes and not in our Actions, in the fal≈øe Repre≈øentation of things to them and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper glo≈ø≈øes that are put upon every thing we do or ≈øay: In our own behalfs we have as yet ≈øaid nothing, tru≈øting that either ≈øhame and Chri≈øtian duty would re≈øtraine men from making ≈øo bold with others good Name and Reputation, or that the ≈øincerity of our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons would evince the fal≈øhood of the≈øe ≈øcandals, and prevent the Peoples Beliefe of them; But we have found that with too much greedine≈ø≈øe they ≈øuck in Reports that tend to the di≈øcredit of others, and that our ≈øilence gives encouragement to bad Rumors of us; ≈øo that in all places they are ≈øpread, and indu≈øtriou≈øly propagated as well among≈øt them that know us, as them that know us not, the fir≈øt being fed with Jealou≈øies that there is more in our de≈øigns then appeares, that there is ≈øomething of danger in the bottom of our hearts, not yet di≈øcovered: that we are driven on by others, that we are even di≈øcontented and irre≈øolved, that no body yet knowes what we would have, or where our de≈øires will end; whil≈øt they that know us not are made believe any ≈øtrange conceit of us, that we would Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell all mens e≈øtates, that we would have no di≈øtinction of Orders and Dignities among≈øt men, that we are indeed for no government, but a Popular con≈øu≈øion; and then againe that we have bin Agents for the King, and now for the Queen; That we are Athei≈øts, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti≈øcripturi≈øts, Je≈øuites and indeed any thing, that is hatefull and of evill repute among≈øt men.</p>
            <p>All which we could without ob≈øervance pa≈øs over, remembring what is promi≈øed to be the Portion of good men, were the damage only per≈øonall, but ≈øince the ends of ≈øuch Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors are purpo≈øely to make us u≈øele≈ø≈øe and un≈øerviceable to the Common-wealth, we are nece≈ø≈øitated to open our brea≈øts and ≈øhew the world our in≈øides, for removing of tho≈øe ≈øeandalls that lye upon us, and likewi≈øe for manife≈øting plainly and particularly what our de≈øires are, and in what we will center and acquie≈øs: all which we ≈øhall pre≈øent to publike view and con≈øideration, not pertinatiou≈øly or Magi≈øterially, as concluding other mens judgements, but manife≈øting our own, for our further vindication, and for the procuring of a Bond and la≈øting e≈øtabli≈øhment for the Commonwealth.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, Then it will be requi≈øite that we expre≈øs our ≈øelves concerning Levelling, for which we ≈øuppo≈øe is commonly meant an equalling of mens e≈øtates, and taking away the proper right and Title that every man has to what is his own. This as we have formerly declared again≈øt, particularly in our petition of the 11 of Sept. ≈øo do we again profe≈ø≈øe that to attempt an inducing the ≈øame is mo≈øt injurious, unle≈ø≈øe there did precede an univer≈øall a≈ø≈øent thereunto from all and every one of the People. Nor doe we, under favour, judge it within the Power of a Repre≈øentative it ≈øelfe, becau≈øe although their power is ≈øupreame, yet it is but deputative and of tru≈øt, and con≈øequently mu≈øt be re≈øtrained expre≈øly or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citely, to ≈øome particulars e≈ø≈øential as well to the Peoples ≈øafety and freedom as to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent Government</p>
            <p>The Community among≈øt the primitive Chri≈øtians, was <hi>Voluntary,</hi> not <hi>Coactive;</hi> they
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:61868:3"/>
               <hi>brought</hi> their goods and laid them at the Apo≈øtles feet, they were not enjoyned to bring them, it was the effect of their Charity and heavenly mindedne≈ø≈øe, which the ble≈ø≈øed Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtles begot in them, and not the Injunction of any Con≈øtitution, which as it was but for a ≈øhort time done, and in but two or three places, that the Scripture makes mention of, ≈øo does the very doing of it there and the Apo≈øtles an≈øwer to him that detained a part, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply that it was not e≈øteemed a duty, but reckoned a voluntary act occa≈øioned by the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant mea≈øure of faith that was in tho≈øe Chri≈øtians and Apo≈øtles.</p>
            <p>We profe≈øs therefore that we never had it in our thoughts to Level mens e≈øttates, it being the utmo≈øt of our aime that the Common-wealth be reduced to ≈øuch a pa≈ø≈øe that every man may with as much ≈øecurity as may be enjoy his propriety.</p>
            <p>We know very well that in all Ages tho≈øe men that engage them≈øelves again≈øt Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, unju≈øt and Arbitrary proceedings in Magi≈øtrats, have ≈øuffered under ≈øuch appellati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the People being purpo≈øely frighted from that wich is good by in≈øinuations of ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary evill.</p>
            <p>But be it ≈øo, we mu≈øt notwith≈øtanding di≈øcharge our Duties, which being performed, the ≈øucce≈ø≈øe is in Gods hand to who≈øe good plea≈øure we mu≈øt leave the cleering of mens ≈øpirits, our only certainty being Tranquillity of mind, and peace of Con≈øcience.</p>
            <p>For di≈øtinction of Orders and Dignities, We think them ≈øo far needfull, as they are animo≈øities of vertue, or requi≈øite for the maintenance of the Magi≈øtracy and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we thinke they were never intended for the nouri≈øhment of Ambition, or ≈øubjuga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the People but only to pre≈øerve the due re≈øpect and obedience in the People which is nece≈ø≈øary for the better execution of the Laws.</p>
            <p>That we are for Government and again≈øt Popular Confu≈øion, we conceive all our actions declare, when rightly con≈øidered, our aim having bin all along to reduce it as near as might be to perfection, and certainly we know very well the pravity and corruption of mans heart is ≈øuch that there could be no living without it; and that though Tyranny is ≈øo exce≈ø≈øively bad, yet of the two extreames, Confu≈øion is the wor≈øt: Tis ≈øomewhat a ≈øtrange con≈øequence to infer that becau≈øe we have laboured ≈øo earne≈øtly for a good Government, therefore we would have none at all; Becau≈øe we would have the dead and exorbitant Branches pruned, and better ≈øciens grafted, therefore we would pluck the Tree up by the roots.</p>
            <p>Yet thus have we been mi≈øconceived, and mi≈ørepre≈øented to the world, under which we mu≈øt ≈øuffer, till God ≈øees it fitting in his good time to cleer ≈øuch har≈øh mi≈øtakes, by which many, even good men keep a di≈øtance from us.</p>
            <p>For tho≈øe weake ≈øuppo≈øitions of ≈øome of us being Agents for the King or Queen, we think it needful to ≈øay no more but this, That though we have not bin any way violent again≈øt the per≈øons of them, or their Partie, as having aimed at the conver≈øion of all, and the de≈øtruction of none, yet doe we verily beleeve that tho≈øe Principles and Maxims of Government which are mo≈øt fundamentally oppo≈øite to the Prerogative, and the Kings intere≈øt, take their fir≈øt ri≈øe and originall from us, many whereof though at fir≈øt ≈øtarled at, and di≈øown'd by tho≈øe that profe≈ø≈øed the greate≈øt oppo≈øition to him, have yet ≈øince been taken up by them and put in practi≈øe: and this we think is ≈øufficient, though much more might be ≈øaid to cleer us from any Agency for that Party.</p>
            <p>It is likewi≈øe ≈øugge≈øted that we are acted by others, who have other ends then appear to us; we an≈øwer. That that cannot be, ≈øince every thing has its ri≈øe among≈øt our ≈øelves, and ≈øince tho≈øe things we bring to light cannot conduce to the ends of any but the publike weale of the Nation.</p>
            <p>All our De≈øires, Petitions and Papers are directly oppo≈øite to all corrupt Intere≈øts; nor
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61868:4"/>have any, credit with us, but per≈øons well known, and of certain aboads, and ≈øuch as have given ≈øound and undeniable te≈øtimonies of the truth of their affection to their Country: Be≈øides, the things we promote, are not good onely in appearance, but ≈øen≈øibly ≈øo: not moulded nor contrived by the ≈øubtill or politick Principles of the World, but plainly produced and nakedly ≈øent, without any in≈øinuating arts, relying wholly upon the appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent and univer≈øall beleefe they carry in them≈øelves; and that is it which convinces and engages us in the promotion thereof. So that that ≈øugge≈øtion has not in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>eed any foundation in it ≈øelf, but is purpo≈øely framed, as we conceive, to make us afraid one of another, and to di≈øable us in the promotion of tho≈øe good things that tend to the freedom and happine≈ø≈øe of the Common-wealth.</p>
            <p>For our being Je≈øuits, either in Order or Principles, as 'tis ≈øeverally reported of us; Though the ea≈øie≈øt Negative is hardly proved; yet we can ≈øay, That tho≈øe on whom the fir≈øt is principally fix'd, are married, and were never over Sea: and we think Marriage is never di≈øpenc'd withall in that Order, and that none can be admitted into the Order but ≈øuch as are per≈øonally pre≈øent. 'Tis hard that we are put to expre≈ø≈øe thus much; and haply we might better pa≈ø≈øe ≈øuch reports over in ≈øilence; but that we beleeve the very mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them publickly, will be an an≈øwer to them, and make ≈øuch as foment them a≈øham'd of ≈øuch generally condemned wayes of di≈øcrediting and bla≈øting the Reputation of other men. For the principles of Je≈øuits, we profe≈ø≈øe we know not what they are; but they are generally ≈øaid to be full of craft and worldly policy; and therefore exceedingly diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from that plainne≈øs and ≈øimplicity that is apparantly vi≈øible in all our procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings.</p>
            <p>Whereas its ≈øaid, we are Athei≈øts and Anti≈øcripturi≈øts, we profe≈ø≈øe that we beleeve there is one eternall and omnipotent God, the Author and Pre≈øerver of all things in the world. To who≈øe will and directions, written fir≈øt in our hearts, and afterwards in his ble≈ø≈øed Word, we ought to ≈øquare our actions and conver≈øations. And though we are not ≈øo ≈øtrict upon the formall and Ceremonial part of his Service, the method, manner, and per≈øonall injunction being not ≈øo clearly made out unto us, nor the nece≈ø≈øary requi≈øites which his Officers and Mini≈øters ought to be furni≈øhed withall as yet appearing to ≈øome of us in any that pretend thereunto: yet for the manife≈øtation of Gods love in Chri≈øt, it is cleerly a≈ø≈øented unto by us; and the practicall and mo≈øt reall part of Religion is as readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ≈øubmitted unto by us, as being, in our apprehen≈øions, the mo≈øt eminent and the mo≈øt excellent in the world, and as proceeding from no other but that God who is Goodne≈ø≈øe it ≈øelf: and we humbly de≈øire his Goodne≈ø≈øe daily more and more to conform our hearts to a willing and ≈øincere obedience thereunto.</p>
            <p>For our not being preferred to Offices and Places of profit and credit, which is urged to be the ground of our di≈ø≈øatisfaction, we ≈øay, That although we know no rea≈øon why we ≈øhould not be equally capable of them with other men, nor why our publick Affection ≈øhould be any barr or hinderance thereunto: Yet on the other ≈øide, we ≈øuppo≈øe we can truly ≈øay of our ≈øelves, that we have not been ≈øo earne≈øt and ≈øolicitous after them as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: and that in the Catalogue of Sutors, very few that are reckoned of us, are to be found. We are very ≈øorry that ≈øo general a change of Officers is propo≈øed, which we judge of no ≈ømall di≈øparagement to our Cau≈øe; and do think it be≈øt, that in removals of that kinde, the ground ≈øhould not be difference in opinion, either in Religious or Civil Matters, but corruption or breach of Tru≈øt; con≈øidering the mi≈øery which befalls whole Families upon ≈øuch Changes; and that di≈øcontents are thereby increa≈øed: Whereas we hold it nece≈ø≈øary that all wayes of compo≈øure and acquieting tho≈øe ≈øtorms which the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding differences and di≈øtractions have begotten, be with utmo≈øt care and prudence en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured.</p>
            <pb n="7" facs="tcp:61868:4"/>
            <p>And whereas 'tis urged, That if we were in power, we would bear our ≈øelves as Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannically as other have done: We confe≈øs indeed, that the experimentall defections of ≈øo many men as have ≈øucceeded in Authority, and the exceeding difference we have hitherto found in the ≈øame men in a low, and in an exalted condition, makes us even mi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tru≈øt our own hearts, and hardly beleeve our own Re≈øolutions of the contrary. And therefore we have propo≈øed ≈øuch an E≈øtabli≈øhment, as ≈øuppo≈øing men to be too flexible and yeelding to worldly Temptations, they ≈øhould not yet have a means or opportunity either to injure particulars, or prejudice the Publick, without extreme hazard, and appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent danger to them≈øelves. Be≈øides, to the objection we have further to ≈øay, That we aim not at power in our ≈øelves, our Principles and De≈øires being in no mea≈øure of ≈øelf-concernment: nor do we relie for obtaining the ≈øame upon ≈øtrength, or a forcible ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtruction; but ≈øolely upon that inbred and per≈øwa≈øive power that is in all good and ju≈øt things, to make their own way in the hearts of men, and ≈øo to procure their own E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtabli≈øhment.</p>
            <p>And that makes us at this time naked and defencele≈ø≈øe as we are, and amid≈øt ≈øo many di≈øcouragements on all hands to per≈øevere in our motions and de≈øires of good to the Nation; although di≈øowned therein at ≈øuch a time when the doing thereof can be interpreted no other but a politick delivering us up to ≈ølaughter, by ≈øuch as we took for Friends, our brethren of ≈øeverall Churches; and for whom with truth of affection we have even in the mo≈øt difficult times done many Services: all which, and what≈øoever el≈øe can be done again≈øt us, we ≈øhall reckon but as badges of our ≈øincerity, and be no whit di≈øcouraged thereby from the di≈øcharge of our duties.</p>
            <p>For the di≈ø-≈øatisfactions that be upon many good mens ≈øpirits, for that they are not a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certained whereunto all our motions tend, and in what they will center,</p>
            <p>Though, we conceive, they may have received ≈øome general ≈øatisfaction from what we have formerly at ≈øeverall times propounded; yet ≈øince they were not di≈øpo≈øed into ≈øuch a form and condition as to become practicable; we have, with the be≈øt care and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities God hath afforded us, ca≈øt the ≈øame into a Modell and Platform, which we ≈øhall ≈øpeedily pre≈øent unto the view and con≈øideration of all, as the <hi>Standard</hi> and ultimate ≈øcope of our De≈øignes, that ≈øo (in ea≈øe of approvall) it may be ≈øub≈øcribed and returned as agreed upon by the People. And thus far, we conceive, we may without offence or prejudice to Authority, proceed; and which we the rather do, becau≈øe we know no better, and indeed no other way or means (but by ≈øuch an Agreement) to remove (as much as may be) all di≈øgu≈øts and heart-burnings, and to ≈øettle the Common-wealth upon the faire≈øt probabilities of a la≈øting Peace, and contentfull E≈øtabli≈øhment.</p>
            <p>The Agreement of the People which was pre≈øented by his Excellency and the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the Army to the Right Honourable the Commons in Parliament, although in many things ≈øhort (according to our apprehen≈øions) of what is nece≈ø≈øary for the good of the Common-wealth, and ≈øatisfaction of the People; particularly, in that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth no provi≈øion for the certain removall of notorious and generally complained of grievances: And although it hath ≈øome things of much hazard to the Publick,‚Äî yet, had it been put in execution, we ≈øhould ≈øcarcely have interrupted the proceedings thereof, ≈øince therein is contained many things of great and important concernment to the Common-wealth. But ≈øeeing the time propo≈øed therein for reducing the ≈øame into practice, is now pa≈øt, and that likewi≈øe the generality of the people have not, or do not approve of the ≈øame, for the rea≈øons (as we ≈øuppo≈øe) fore-mentioned: We have thought fit to revi≈øe it, making onely ≈øuch alterations therein as we conceive really nece≈ø≈øary for the welfare, ≈øecurity and ≈øafety of the People, together with additionall Provi≈øions for the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:61868:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>taking away of tho≈øe Burdens and Grievances which may without reall prejudice to the Management of publick Affairs be removed.</p>
            <p>And becau≈øe it is e≈ø≈øentiall to the nature of ≈øuch an Agreement to take its ri≈øe from the People, we have therefore purpo≈øely declined the pre≈øentment thereof to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament: and conceive it may ≈øpeedily proceed to Sub≈øcription, and ≈øo to further pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, without any interruption to this Repre≈øentative, untill the ≈øea≈øon prefix'd in the Agreement, for the a≈ø≈øembling another: By who≈øe immediate ≈øucce≈ø≈øion, without any intervall, the Affairs of the Common-wealth may ≈øuffer no ≈øtop or intermi≈ø≈øion.</p>
            <p>La≈øtly, We conceive we are much mi≈øtaken to being judged impatient, and over-violent in our motions for the publick Good. To which we an≈øwer, That could we have had any a≈ø≈øurance that what is de≈øired ≈øhould have otherwi≈øe, or by any have been done; and had not had ≈øome ta≈øte of the relinqui≈øhment of many good things that were promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed, we ≈øhould not have been ≈øo earne≈øt and urgent for the doing thereof.</p>
            <p>Though we know likewi≈øe it hath been very cu≈øtomary in ≈øuch heretofore as never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended any freedom to the Nation, to except only again≈øt the ≈øea≈øon, and to protract the time ≈øo long, till they became ≈øufficiently impowred to ju≈øtifie the totall denyall and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu≈øall thereof. However, the main rea≈øon of our proceeding as we do, is, becau≈øe we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the way of a ≈øettlement by an Agreement of the People before any other what≈øoever.</p>
            <p>And thus the world may clearly ≈øee what we are, and what we aym at: We are alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ignorant, and do from our hearts abominate all de≈øignes and contrivances of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous con≈øequence which we are ≈øaid (but God knows, untruly) to be labouring withall. Peace and Freedom is our De≈øigne; by War we were never gainers, nor ever wi≈øh to be; and under bondage we have been hitherto ≈øufferers. We de≈øire however, that what is pa≈øt may be forgotten, provided the Common wealth may have amends made it for the time to come. And this from our ≈øoul we de≈øire.</p>
